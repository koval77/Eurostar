# Eurostar
Travel agency website
It is written for school assignment and is based on template from TemplateMonster.com, slightly customised by me. My main effort for this project was building dashboard for administrators and adding database functionality for managing tours, customers, messages etc. Customers can browse  and book tours, writing comments, choose tours from table or from google map. Major technologies I was using were PHP, phpMyAdmin, MySql, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery.
The process of written this assigment is described in assignment.docx file.
