# Eurostar
Travel agency website
It is written for school assignment and is based on template from TemplateMonster.com, slightly customised by me. My main effort for this project was building dashboard for administrators and adding database functionality for managing tours, customers, messages etc. Customers can browse  and book tours, writing comments, choose tours from table or from google map. Major technologies I was using were PHP, phpMyAdmin, MySql, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, Xampp.

# Instalation tips

All images are zipped, to properly display graphic they have to be unpacked into images folder.

To use google map you have to obtain google API key from google.

The process of writing this assigment is described in assignment.docx file.

Remember that in order to use it the database connection variables has to be changed in all connection files.
