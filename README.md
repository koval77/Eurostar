Travel agency website
It is written for school assignment and is based on template from TemplateMonster.com customised, improved and exteneded by me. One of the major improivements for this project was building dashboard for administrators and adding database functionality for managing tours, customers, messages etc. Customers can browse  and book tours, writing comments, choose tours from table or from google map. Major technologies I was using were: PHP, phpMyAdmin, MySql, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, Xampp, Photoshop.
